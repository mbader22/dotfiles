Unthrift, a high quality script typeface, was created by Måns Grebäck in 2015. 
It comes in two versions, First and Second, each with a different set of letters. 

Unthrift is built with large and vivid brush strokes, and inspired by '90s handwriting. 

An alternate alphabet, end letter alphabet, initializing letter alphabet and swash letter alphabet are some of the features. There are also contextual alternates and a lot of ligatures. All these features combined makes for a very fluid and realistic writing, and thousands of possibilities for customization.
