#dotfiles

This are not only my dotfiles. It's the setup i like to start with, when i install Linux on a new machine.

My favorit distribution is Antergos, with the xfce desktop. The goal of this project is, to be able to make a complete Setup with just one command, after installing Antergos with xfce desktop.

Antergos comes with a bunch of preinstalled programms. As in every distribution, there are some programms included, i don't need or i don't like. Some other programms, i like to work with, are not included. With this setup script, i will install my prefered programms and deinstall programms i don't need. The list of programms i like to install respectively deinstall, is not completed yet.

The screenshot below shows my desktop with zsh and vim started.
